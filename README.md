## Problem Statement:
AtliQ Hardware is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America.

Senior executives of this company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this work.

## Goal & Purpose:
This Project is expected to improve the transparency and enable data driven decision-making across markets & functions.And therefore deliver a quantitative benefit of 10% incremental profit 

## Business Model:

&rarr; AtliQ is a manufacturer for Computer Hardwares and manufacture different products. These products are then sent from factory to their warehouse.

&rarr; From warehouse, AtliQ send the products to different Stores like croma, flipkart etc. to sell their products. From these stores people can buy AtliQ products. AtliQ don't sell their products directly to the end user.

&rarr; The stores whom AtliQ sell their product, are called **_Customer_** and People who consume AtliQ's products, are called **_Consumer_**. (Refer to above picture for better understanding)

## Data Modeling
Here you can check the Data Model which is used for this project. In center you can see there are _Fact_ tables which are connected with different _Dimension_ tables. Few _Dimension_ tables are also connected with another _Dimension_ tables.

That's why this Data Model is mixed of **STAR** and **Snowflake** schema.
